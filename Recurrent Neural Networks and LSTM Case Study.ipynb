    "# Recurrent Neural Network and LSTM Case Study\n",
    "### Recurrent Neural Networks\n",
    "According to Quora, in a recurrent neural network the output activations from one or more of the layers of the network are stored. Often these outputs are hidden layer activations.  The next time, an input example to the network is fed and the previouslyâ€“stored outputs are included as additional inputs.\n",
    "In other words, a recurrent neural network takes the output back in as an input.\n",

    "### LSTM\n",
    "LSTM are a building unit for layers of a recurrent neural network (RNN). A RNN composed of LSTM units is often called an LSTM network. A common LSTM unit is composed of a cell, an input gate, an output gate and a forget gate. The cell is responsible for \"remembering\" values over arbitrary time intervals; hence the word \"memory\" in LSTM. Each of the three gates can be thought of as a \"conventional\" artificial neuron, as in a multi-layer (or feedforward) neural network: that is, they compute an activation (using an activation function) of a weighted sum. Intuitively, they can be thought as regulators of the flow of values that goes through the connections of the LSTM; hence the denotation \"gate\". There are connections between these gates and the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The expression long short-term refers to the fact that LSTM is a model for the short-term memory which can last for a long period of time. An LSTM is well-suited to classify, process and predict time series given time lags of unknown size and duration between important events. LSTMs were developed to deal with the exploding and vanishing gradient problem when training traditional RNNs.\n",
